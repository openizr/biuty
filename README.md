## Installation

```bash
yarn add sonar-ui
```


## Features

- A complete list of HTML specs for reusable components, using BEM conventions, performance, SEO and accessibility optimized
- An implementation of those components in popular frontend frameworks (React, VueJS)
- A SASS library containing a small set of useful and essential mixins and classes to build awesome UIs
- A pack of SASS templates for easily implementing your own design system for reusable components, using those mixins
- A list of implemented, ready to use popular CSS design systems (Material, Semantic, Primer, ...)
- A set of SASS variables common to all design systems to tweak them and make your own theme, in minutes, with almost no knowledge


## Advantages
- Performance-focused (light HTML, 100% CSS for design)
- Separation of concerns, dev/graphic designer (no CSS in JS)
- W3C-compliant, accessibility-enabled and SEO friendly
- Easy to use, for both dev (components implemented in popular frameworks) and graphic designer (SASS mixins, variables)
- Framework and design system agnostic - you can implement components in any framework, you can implement your own design system
- Only the essential components, no templates, complex or customized stuff
- Best practices compliant
